Utilizing custom-built Python libraries, SweScribe and stum, the corpus facilitates unprecedented access to historical narratives of Swedish modernity. It offers extensive research opportunities across history, cultural studies, linguistics, and media analysis, enabling detailed examinations of societal shifts, media representation, and linguistic developments throughout twentieth-century Sweden.},
